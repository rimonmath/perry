//! #6759 Phase C1: first-class Shape records, keyed on keys_array identity.
//!
//! A shared `keys_array` already IS a shape (same pointer ⟹ same ordered
//! key list, because mutation always forks a private clone). This module
//! promotes that identity into an explicit per-shape key→slot table,
//! replacing two per-consumer tables that re-derived the same map:
//!
//! * `KEYS_INDEX` — keyed per OBJECT, so 10k same-shape siblings built 10k
//!   private indexes;
//! * `WIDE_KEY_INDEX` — keys-keyed but capped at a 4-entry LRU, so any
//!   working set past 4 wide shapes thrashed.
//!
//! Trust model (inherited from both): entries are accelerators, never
//! authoritative. Every hit re-validates the stored key bytes at the
//! returned slot; a recycled keys_array address or an in-place mutation
//! fails validation, drops the entry, and the caller falls back to the
//! linear scan. Staleness is therefore harmless; the dead-owner prune
//! exists for memory, not correctness. See docs/shape-tree-plan.md.
